# Charlie Apple

A bespoke front-end site made with Node.js, Sass and a bit of GSAP for a web design, graphic design and marketing company.

## Rebrand

After the redesign, Charlie Apple decided to completely rebrand to **Bell Pepper Design**.

## Brief

Bell Pepper Design (formerly Charlie Apple) wanted a complete re-design of their old website. They gave me free rein over the design, but wanted the copy and page names to stay the same for their SEO.

I designed the site in Adobe XD and, upon approval, made a bespoke app using a Node.js development environment with Gulp, Pug, Sass and Javascript.
